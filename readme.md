While I learned Html and Css, I decided to repeat the site from this template:
https://www.figma.com/file/o8Gb0pH7cYETexg7UUYIvZ/Sushi-Restaurant-Design-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1&t=zGmtODqEeVd3o4ST-0

Made it responsive for different devices.

link to my work:
https://gshaa.github.io/sushi/

ps: while still learning javascript, I a little fixed the navigation menu
